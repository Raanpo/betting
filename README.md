Hey guys!

Sometimes betting on teams is stressful so using a simple stat like the total wins, this program can tell you what odds you should look for.

Comes with 5 main functions

1. If a team has won a game and you want to add it manually, use the first function to add one to the total wins of a team.
2. If a team has lost a game and you want to add it manually, use the second function to add one to the total losses of a team.
3. Once you are done with changes, the third command would write the end results to a file so you can use the new information next time.
4. This is the main function which looks at the amount of wins each team has and calculate the odds that you should look for.
5. If you need a refresher on what the current standings in your league looks like, this function will list all of the teams and their win-lose.
